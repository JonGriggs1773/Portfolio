    <title>About Jon Griggs!</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Hello! My name is Jonathen Griggs, as I am sure you have figured out by now. I currently work remote as a software engineer at a coding bootcamp, and I enjoy it a lot. I consider myself a hybrid between a full-stack and back-end engineer, as those are the areas in software development I am most passionate about. Before coding, I worked in the blue collar industry as a mixer operator (my fancy way of saying I delivered concrete). This job, however, was just as stepping stone to pay my bills while I found, and pursued my true calling in the tech industry. My first consideration to pursue tech, in general, came to me in the form of a Youtube ad for a coding bootcamp. Upon seeing this ad, I scheduled a phone call with one of their advisors, and riddled that poor man with questions about the industry, how the bootcamp worked, what I could do with the education, and so much more. This phone call lasted nearly 3 hours!!! By the end of it I had made my decision, and enrolled myself at Coding Dojo! Upon my graduation, I scored an interview with that very same bootcamp, and after an extensive process, landed the job. For my future, I would love to be primarily a back-end developer for a company that stands for something important. I want to be a part of the generation that pushes tech to the next level. If you want to learn more about me, or want to just connect in general, you can use the "@" icon at the bottom of the page to send me an email. I check it everyday, and I will be sure to get back to you as soon as possible. Thank you for reading, and thank you for letting me share my story.</p>
